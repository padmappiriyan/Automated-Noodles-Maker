Automated Maggie Making Machine with Enhanced Functionality  
Problem Statement:   
In today's fast-paced lifestyle, people often find it challenging to prepare meals that are both quick and satisfying. The traditional method of cooking maggie noodles requires constant monitoring and manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, there is a growing demand for automation in kitchen appliances to make cooking more convenient and efficient.  
Solution:  
To address these challenges, an automated maggie making machine is proposed. This machine aims to provide a solution that automates the process of cooking maggie noodles, offering precise control over cooking parameters such as water temperature, quantity of noodles, and cooking time. By incorporating advanced sensors and motors, this machine can ensure consistent and perfectly cooked noodles every time, saving time and effort for users.  
   
  
Components:  
-	Arduino Board:    To control the overall operation of the machine.  
-	Temperature Sensor:    To monitor the water temperature for cooking noodles.  
-	Water Level Sensor:     To ensure the correct amount of water is added.  
-	Weight Sensor:    To measure the quantity of noodles and water accurately.  
-	IR Sensor:    To detect the presence of the cooking vessel and prevent operation if the vessel is not placed correctly.  
-	Stirrer Motor:   To stir the noodles while cooking.  
-	Servo Motor:    To dispense masala (seasoning) packet  
-	LCD Display with Touch Screen  
  
Features:  
	Precise Ingredient Measurement: The machine will measure the quantity of noodles and water accurately using the weight sensor.  
  
	Automatic Ingredient Dispensing: The servo motor will dispense the masala packet automatically.  


1.Water Heating Process 
To automatically heat water for your Maggie noodles machine, integrate a heating element with an Arduino-controlled relay module. Use a waterproof DS18B20 temperature sensor to monitor water temperature, ensuring safety and efficiency. Implement a control algorithm to activate the heating element when the water temperature is below the target level, switching it off once the desired temperature is reached. Include safety features like a water level sensor to prevent heating without sufficient water and a timer to avoid overheating. Provide a user interface, such as an LCD display, to show the current temperature. 
2.Removing Water 
removing excess water from cooked noodles is to use a centrifugal spinning mechanism. This involves a spinning basket with perforations to hold the noodles, placed inside the cooking container. A motor is attached to spin the basket rapidly, using centrifugal force to push water out through the perforations. The drained water is collected separately. 
 
3.Add Powder: 
To add accurate powder weight measurement to your automatic noodles Maggie making machine project,  use a load cell as the sensor.  
Choose a load cell with a suitable capacity for the maximum weight of powder, and connect it to an HX711 amplifier module, which converts the analog signal to digital for the Arduino. Calibrate the load cell using known weights to ensure accuracy. Read the load cell data with the HX711 library, and use it to control the powder dispenser. Account for tare weight if needed, and ensure a stable environment for the load cell. This setup will enable precise measurement and dispensing of powder for your noodles Maggie machine. 
4.	Stirring the Noodles  
To automate the stirring process in your automatic noodles making project, attach a motorized stirrer to the bottom of the cooking container. Design a stirring mechanism with a paddle or whisk securely mounted to the motor shaft. Connect the motor to the Arduino board and control its speed and direction using suitable motor drivers. Implement safety features to prevent accidents, such as automatic shut-off if the stirring mechanism malfunctions. 
5.Maintenance and Cleaning Mode:  
Design the machine with a self-cleaning feature that flushes the cooking area with hot water after each use, making maintenance easier. Also, ensure that parts in contact with food are easily detachable and dishwasher safe.
